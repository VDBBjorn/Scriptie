@article{Shani2011,
abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a rec- ommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation sys- tems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss howto compare recom- menders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application.We focus on comparative studies, where a fewalgorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms.We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms.We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and fi- nally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation.We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties.We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.},

@article{Herlocker2004,
abstract = {Recommender systems have been evaluated in many, often incomparable, ways. In this article, we review the key decisions in evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems: the user tasks being evaluated, the types of analysis and datasets being used, the ways in which prediction quality is measured, the evaluation of prediction attributes other than quality, and the user-based evaluation of the system as a whole. In addition to reviewing the evaluation strategies used by prior researchers, we present empirical results from the analysis of various accuracy metrics on one content domain where all the tested metrics collapsed roughly into three equivalence classes. Metrics within each equivalency class were strongly correlated, while metrics from different equivalency classes were uncorrelated.},

abstract = {Social bookmarking websites allow users to store, organize, and search bookmarks of web pages. Users of these services can an- notate their bookmarks by using informal tags and other metadata, such as titles, descriptions, etc. In this paper, we focus on the task of item recommendation for social bookmarking websites, i.e. pre- dicting which unseen bookmarks a user might like based on his or her profile. We examine how we can incorporate the tags and other metadata into a nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering (CF) algo- rithm, by replacing the traditional usage-based similarity metrics by tag overlap, and by fusing tag-based similarity with usage-based similarity. In addition, we perform experiments with content-based filtering by using the metadata content to recommend interesting items. We generate recommendations directly based on Kullback- Leibler divergence of the metadata language models, and we ex- plore the use of this metadata in calculating user and item simi- larities. We perform our experiments on three data sets from two different domains: Delicious, CiteULike and BibSonomy.},

@article{Adomavicius2005,
abstract = { This paper presents an overview of the field of recommender systems and describes the current generation of recommendation methods that are usually classified into the following three main categories: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendation approaches. This paper also describes various limitations of current recommendation methods and discusses possible extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and make recommender systems applicable to an even broader range of applications. These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multicriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations.},

@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {Online news reading has become very popular as the web provides access to news articles from millions of sources around the world. A key challenge of news websites is to help users find the articles that are interesting to read. In this paper, we present our research on developing personalized news recommendation system in Google News. For users who are logged in and have explicitly enabled web history, the recommendation system builds profiles of users' news interests based on their past click behavior. To understand how users' news interests change over time, we first conducted a large-scale analysis of anonymized Google News users click logs. Based on the log analysis, we developed a Bayesian framework for predicting users' current news interests from the activities of that particular user and the news trends demonstrated in the activity of all users. We combine the content-based recommendation mechanism which uses learned user profiles with an existing collaborative filtering mechanism to generate personalized news recommendations. The hybrid recommender system was deployed in Google News. Experiments on the live traffic of Google News website demonstrated that the hybrid method improves the quality of news recommendation and increases traffic to the site.},
