abstract = {The problem of information overload has been a relevant and active research topic for the past twenty years. Since then, numerous algorithms and recommendation approaches have been proposed, which gives rise to a new type of problem: recommendation algorithm overload. Although hybrid recommendation techniques, which combine the strengths of individual recommenders, have become well-accepted, the procedure of building and tuning a hybrid recommender is still a tedious and time-consuming process. In our work, we focus on dynamically building personalized hybrid recommender systems on an individual user basis. By means of a dynamic online learning strategy we combine the most appropriate recommendation algorithms for a user based on realtime relevance feedback. Learning effectiveness of genetic algorithms, machine learning techniques and other optimization approaches will be studied in both an offline and online setting. Â© 2013 ACM.},
