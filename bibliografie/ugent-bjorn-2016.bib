abstract = { This paper presents an overview of the field of recommender systems and describes the current generation of recommendation methods that are usually classified into the following three main categories: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendation approaches. This paper also describes various limitations of current recommendation methods and discusses possible extensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and make recommender systems applicable to an even broader range of applications. These extensions include, among others, an improvement of understanding of users and items, incorporation of the contextual information into the recommendation process, support for multicriteria ratings, and a provision of more flexible and less intrusive types of recommendations.},

abstract = {Feature selection has been the focus of interest for quite some time and much work has been done.With the creation of huge databases and the consequent requirements for good machine learning techniques, new problems arise and novel approaches to feature selection are in demand. This survey is a comprehensive overview of many existing methods from the 1970's to the present. It identifies four steps of a typical feature selection method, and categorizes the different existing methods in terms of generation procedures and evaluation functions, and reveals hitherto unattempted combinations of generation procedures and evaluation functions. Representative methods are chosen from each category for detailed explanation and discussion via example. Benchmark datasets with different characteristics are used for comparative study. The strengths and weaknesses of different methods are explained. Guidelines for applying feature selection methods are given based on data types and domain characteristics. This survey identifies the future research areas in feature selection, introduces newcomers to this field, and paves the way for practitioners who search for suitable methods for solving domain-specific real-world applications.},

This is also called as text data mining or knowledge discovery. It can be viewed as an extension of data mining or knowledge from structured databases. At present, the stored information is increasing tremendously day by day. This is unstructured form so we can not extract the needed information. Some data mining techniques are used to extract the useful information from text documents, such as classification, clustering, visualization and information extraction.

abstract = {Implicit in many information retrieval model is logic. These logics are hardly ever formalised. This paper formalises non-classical logic underlying information retrieval. It shows how a particular conditional logic is the 'right' logic to do Information Retrieval. Its relationship to exisitng retrieval mechanisms is investigated. The semantics of the logic are expressed in probability theory, and evaluated through a possible-world analysis, thus establishing an intensional logic. In doing so, we motivate a new principle, the logic uncertainty principle, which gives a measure of the uncertainty associated with an inference.},

@article{Forman2003,
abstract = {Machine learning for text classification is the cornerstone of document categorization, news filtering, document routing, and personalization. In text domains, effective feature selection is essential to make the learning task efficient and more accurate. This paper presents an empirical comparison of twelve feature selection methods (e.g. Information Gain) evaluated on a benchmark of 229 text classification problem instances that were gathered from Reuters, TREC, OHSUMED, etc. The results are analyzed from multiple goal perspectives—accuracy, F-measure, precision, and recall—since each is appropriate in different situations. The results reveal that a new feature selection metric we call 'Bi-Normal Separation' (BNS), outperformed the others by a substantial margin in most situations. This margin widened in tasks with high class skew, which is rampant in text classification problems and is particularly challenging for induction algorithms. A new evaluation methodology is offered that focuses on the needs of the data mining practitioner faced with a single dataset who seeks to choose one (or a pair of) metrics that are most likely to yield the best performance. From this perspective, BNS was the top single choice for all goals except precision, for which Information Gain yielded the best result most often. This analysis also revealed, for example, that Information Gain and Chi-Squared have correlated failures, and so they work poorly together. When choosing optimal pairs of metrics for each of the four performance goals, BNS is consistently a member of the pair—e.g., for greatest recall, the pair BNS + F1-measure yielded the best performance on the greatest number of tasks by a considerable margin.},

The focus of the presentation is on algorithms and heuristics used to find documents relevant to the user request and to find them fast. Through multiple examples, the most commonly used algorithms and heuristics needed are tackled. To facilitate understanding and applications, introductions to and discussions of computational linguistics, natural language processing, probability theory and library and computer science are provided. While this text focuses on algorithms and not on commercial product per se, the basic strategies used by many commercial products are described. Techniques that can be used to find information on the Web, as well as in other large information collections, are included.  This volume is an invaluable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students working in information retrieval and databases. For instructors, a set of Powerpoint slides, including speaker notes, are available online from the authors.},

With the categorizing framework, we continue our efforts toward-building an integrated system for intelligent feature selection. A unifying platform is proposed as an intermediate step. An illustrative example is presented to show how existing feature selection algorithms can be integrated into a meta algorithm that can take advantage of individual algorithms. An added advantage of doing so is to help a user employ a suitable algorithm without knowing details of each algorithm. Some real-world applications are included to demonstrate the use of feature selection in data mining. We conclude this work by identifying trends and challenges of feature selection research and development.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss grading, a meta-classification technique that tries to identify and correct incorrect predictions at the base level. While stacking uses the predictions of the base classifiers as meta-level attributes, we use graded predictions (i.e., predictions that have been marked as correct or incorrect) as meta-level classes. For each base classifier, one meta classifier is learned whose task is to predict when the base classifier will err. Hence, just like stacking may be viewed as a generalization of voting, grading may be viewed as a generalization of selection by cross-validation and therefore fills a conceptual gap in the space of meta-classification schemes. Our experimental evaluation shows that this technique results in a performance gain that is quite comparable to that achieved by stacking, while both, grading and stacking outperform their simpler counter-parts voting and selection by cross-validation.},
